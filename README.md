# mLearning

mLearning is a machine learning tools module that provides an efficient way to invoke and use machine learning methods. It is recommended to install this module through npm install neurons.me.

## Usage

The index.js file in your mLearning module is responsible for loading the methods from the src/methods directory and exporting them. Here is an example structure:

```js
// Load the methods from the src/methods directory
const method1 = require('./src/methods/method1');
const method2 = require('./src/methods/method2');
// ... add more methods as needed

// Export the methods
module.exports = {
  method1,
  method2,
  // ... export more methods as needed
};
```

Make sure to adjust the paths and filenames according to your actual project structure. This code assumes that your methods are located in the src/methods directory and that you have separate files for each method (e.g., method1.js, method2.js).

Remember to include the required logic inside each method file to perform the desired mLearning functionality.

## Testing

You can test your mLearning module by running npm test or executing the src/test.js file. The test script will import the mLearning module and test the functionality of the loaded methods.

Ensure that the test script correctly imports the mLearning module using the relative path:

```js
const mLearning = require('./index');
```

This will import the mLearning module from the same directory as the test script.

#### Example

Here is an example usage of the mLearning module in a project:

```js
// Load the mLearning module
const mLearning = require('neurons.me').mLearning;

// Invoke the method1 from mLearning
const result = mLearning.method1();
console.log('Result of method1:', result);

// Invoke the method2 from mLearning
const output = mLearning.method2('input data');
console.log('Output of method2:', output);
```

This example assumes that you have installed the neurons.me package, which includes the mLearning module. Adjust the import statement according to your project setup.

Feel free to add more methods to the mLearning module and use them as needed in your project.
