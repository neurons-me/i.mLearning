# i.mLearning

-----------

### [Project Status : Experimental and Under Development, Subject to Major Changes]

`i.mlearning` is an experimental module under development within the `all.this` family, specifically designed to streamline the process of setting up structured datasets for supervised learning. The module aims to **provide a standardized framework for organizing and labeling data**, making it optimally structured for training machine learning models, particularly in conjunction with the [neurons.me](https://neurons.me) platform.

[mlearning.studio](https://mlearning.studio)

The module is in active development, and as such, it is subject to significant changes as we refine our approach and methodologies to best support supervised learning processes.

----------

## Core Vision and Purpose
The primary goal of `i.mlearning` is to facilitate the creation of well-organized, labeled datasets that can be directly utilized for training machine learning models. This involves:

- **Structured Data Directory**: Providing a template or blueprint for organizing data files, such as images or audio clips, into labeled directories (e.g., `cats/` for cat images) to support straightforward supervised learning.
- **Data Labeling Consistency**: Ensuring that all data within the structure is appropriately labeled and categorized to aid in the accurate training of machine learning models, enhancing the overall effectiveness and reliability of the learning process.
- **Integration with neurons.me**: Making the structured and labeled data easily accessible and compatible with neurons.me, allowing for seamless data processing, model training, and analysis within the platform.

## Getting Started
To begin experimenting with `i.mlearning`, you can clone or download the module and explore the provided directory structures and guidelines. As this module is still under development, we encourage experimentation and feedback:

```bash
npm i i.mlearning
```

**Note:** As `i.mlearning` is in experimental mode, please be prepared for ongoing changes and updates. Your feedback and contributions can significantly shape its evolution.

## Contributing to `i.mlearning`
We welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community to enhance and refine `i.mlearning`. Whether you have ideas for new features, improvements to existing structures, or feedback on the module's usability, your input is invaluable.

## Licensing and Usage
`i.mlearning` is released under an open-source license, allowing you to use and modify the module freely within your projects. As the module evolves, please refer to the LICENSE file for the most current licensing information.
