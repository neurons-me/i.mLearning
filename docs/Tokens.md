Package Initialization:


10 (י - Yud): Represents the singular point of creation, divinity, and the infinite in the finite.

18 (חי - Chai): As mentioned, this means "life". The custom of giving monetary gifts in multiples of 18 is common in Jewish tradition because of this association.

26 (יהוה - YHWH): This is the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton, the ineffable name of God. The individual letters are Yud (10), Hei (5), Vav (6), and Hei (5), which add up to 26.

32 (לב - Lev): This number, which means "heart" in Hebrew, is significant in Kabbalistic literature, especially in the context of the 32 Paths of Wisdom associated with the Tree of Life.

40 (מ - Mem): Represents transition or change. For instance, the Great Flood during Noah's time lasted 40 days and 40 nights, and Moses spent 40 years leading the Israelites through the desert.

72: In Kabbalah, there's the concept of the 72 names of God, derived from three verses in Exodus 14, each containing 72 letters.

137: This number has intrigued both religious scholars and scientists. It's seen in various Jewish contexts, but it's also known as the Fine Structure Constant in physics, a dimensionless value that describes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.

613: Represents the total number of mitzvot (commandments) in the Torah.

666: While most associated with Christian eschatology, 666 appears in the Hebrew Bible too. For example, in 1 Kings 10:14, it's the weight of the gold that came to King Solomon in a single year.

888: This is the gematria value of the word "Mashiach" (Messiah) when spelled Mem, Shin, Yud, Chet.
