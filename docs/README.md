# `i.mlearning` README

## Introduction to `i.mlearning`
`i.mlearning` is an experimental module under development within the `all.this` family, specifically designed to streamline the process of setting up structured datasets for supervised learning. The module aims to provide a standardized framework for organizing and labeling data, making it optimally structured for training machine learning models, particularly in conjunction with the neurons.me platform.

## Project Status
**Experimental and Under Development:** `i.mlearning` is currently in an experimental phase, focusing on innovating how data is prepared and structured for machine learning. The module is in active development, and as such, it is subject to significant changes as we refine our approach and methodologies to best support supervised learning processes.

## Core Vision and Purpose
The primary goal of `i.mlearning` is to facilitate the creation of well-organized, labeled datasets that can be directly utilized for training machine learning models. This involves:

- **Structured Data Directory**: Providing a template or blueprint for organizing data files, such as images or audio clips, into labeled directories (e.g., `cats/` for cat images) to support straightforward supervised learning.
- **Data Labeling Consistency**: Ensuring that all data within the structure is appropriately labeled and categorized to aid in the accurate training of machine learning models, enhancing the overall effectiveness and reliability of the learning process.
- **Integration with neurons.me**: Making the structured and labeled data easily accessible and compatible with neurons.me, allowing for seamless data processing, model training, and analysis within the platform.

## Anticipated Features
- **Directory Templates for Data**: Guidelines and structures for organizing various types of data, ensuring consistency and compatibility with supervised learning algorithms.
- **Labeling Guidelines**: Best practices and instructions for labeling data within the structured directories, ensuring clarity and consistency across datasets.
- **Tools and Scripts**: Potential development of utilities to assist in setting up and verifying the data structure, automating the preparation process as much as possible.
