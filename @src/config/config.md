This structure ensures:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has its own dedicated directory, ensuring functionalities are neatly organized.
2. **Scalability**: As your module grows, you can easily add more functionalities within each layer or even add more layers without disturbing the existing structure.
3. **Shared Utilities**: Common utility functions or helpers that are used across layers are kept in a central `Utils` directory for ease of access and maintenance.
4. **Data Management**: A dedicated `Data` directory for datasets or models ensures they're separate from your functional code.

Remember, this is just a template. Depending on the specific needs and features of your `i.mlearning` module, you might need to adjust the directory structure accordingly.
