In the context of a relational database and depending on your application, an "entity" can indeed represent a person, place, animal, thing, or even a conceptâ€”essentially any distinct object or item that can have data stored about it. Each type of entity will have its own set of attributes that are relevant to the application's domain.

Here's a more elaborated example of an entity in a table 
that could represent a person in a social network.
 I'll include some common attributes you might find relevant:

 CREATE TABLE persons (
    person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    gender VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(50),
    address_id INT, -- This can be a foreign key to an 'addresses' table
    occupation_id INT, -- This can be a foreign key to an 'occupations' table
    bio TEXT,
    profile_picture_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
