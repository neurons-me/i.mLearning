When using `netstat` or any other network monitoring tool to assess the safety of network connections, the determination of "Safe," "Not Safe," or "Unknown" typically depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:

- **Known ports**: Common ports like 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS are generally considered safe as they are standard for web traffic.
- **Established connections**: Connections to known and trusted IP addresses or domains are often considered safe.
- **Unexpected connections**: Numerous connections to unfamiliar foreign addresses might be flagged as suspicious.
- **Listening ports**: Open ports listening for incoming connections might be a security risk if they aren't required for your system's operation or if they are not properly secured.
- **Process ownership**: Network connections associated with known and trusted applications are usually considered safe, while those owned by unknown or untrusted processes might be considered unsafe.
