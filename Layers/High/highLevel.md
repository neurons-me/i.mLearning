### High Level (Conceptual Overview)

- **Purpose**: Represents the broadest categories or themes.

- Contains:

  - **Configuration Files**: Setup and initialization for high-level processes.
  - **Controllers**: Orchestrating the flow and interaction between the Mid and Granular levels.
  - **Views (if applicable)**: For visual representations, the highest level visual components should be here.

Example:
Given list of categories (Wildlife, Geography, etc.):

High Level:
Might have controllers or functions that deal with selecting the main category, like "Wildlife."
If you're visually representing these categories, you might have large visual blocks or components here.
Mid Level:
Once "Wildlife" is chosen, functions in the Mid level might handle displaying "Biology" or differentiating between marine animals and land animals.
Business logic could handle user interactions specific to this subcategory.
Granular Level:
If a user clicks on "Sharks" under marine animals, the granular level could handle displaying specific data on sharks or pulling up related content.
Fine-tuned utilities or services might fetch specific data points about sharks from a database.
