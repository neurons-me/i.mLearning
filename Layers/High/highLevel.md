### High Level (Conceptual Overview)

Controllers or functions that deal with selecting the main category, like "Wildlife."
If you're visually representing these categories, you might have large visual blocks or components here.

Categories/Themes

- **Purpose**: Represents the broadest categories or themes.
- **Configuration Files**: Setup and initialization for high-level processes.
- **Controllers**: Orchestrating the flow and interaction between the Mid and Granular levels.
- **Views (if applicable)**: For visual representations, the highest level visual components should be here.

### Example:

Given list of categories (Wildlife, Geography, etc.):



---------------------

#### Granular Level:

If a user clicks on "Sharks" under marine animals, the granular level would handle displaying specific data on sharks or pulling up related content.
Fine-tuned utilities or services might fetch specific data points about sharks from a database.
