### Mid Level (Detailed Categories)

- **Purpose**: Delves deeper into specifics, but not the most detailed level. Could represent subcategories or more detailed themes.

- Contains:

  - **Sub-controllers**: Manage the flow within this level, calling on granular functions or operations as needed.
  - **Business Logic**: Code handling specific processes related to the subcategories.
  - **Views (if applicable)**: For visual representations specific to this middle level.

### Example:

Given list of categories (Wildlife, Geography, etc.):

### High Level:

Might have controllers or functions that deal with selecting the main category, like "Wildlife."
If you're visually representing these categories, you might have large visual blocks or components here.

### Mid Level:

Once "Wildlife" is chosen, functions in the Mid level might handle displaying "Biology" or differentiating between marine animals and land animals.
Business logic could handle user interactions specific to this subcategory.

### Granular Level:

If a user clicks on "Sharks" under marine animals, the granular level could handle displaying specific data on sharks or pulling up related content.
Fine-tuned utilities or services might fetch specific data points about sharks from a database.
