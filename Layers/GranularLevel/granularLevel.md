### Granular Level (Fine-grained Details)

- **Purpose**: Represents the most detailed data points, functionalities, or entities.
- Contains:
  - **Utilities/Helpers**: Functions that perform very specific tasks.
  - **Models**: Data structures or classes for the finest details.
  - **Services**: Functions that might interface with databases or other external systems at a granular level.
  - **Views (if applicable)**: Visual components or displays for these very specific entities.


### High Level:

Might have controllers or functions that deal with selecting the main category, like "Wildlife."
If you're visually representing these categories, you might have large visual blocks or components here.

### Mid Level:

Once "Wildlife" is chosen, functions in the Mid level might handle displaying "Biology" or differentiating between marine animals and land animals.
Business logic could handle user interactions specific to this subcategory.

### Granular Level:

If a user clicks on "Sharks" under marine animals, the granular level could handle displaying specific data on sharks or pulling up related content.
Fine-tuned utilities or services might fetch specific data points about sharks from a database.
