/* A character can be any letter, number, punctuation, special character, or space.
 Each of these characters takes up one byte of space in a computer's memory. 
 Some Unicode characters, like emojis and some letters in non-Latin alphabets, 
 take up two bytes of space and therefore count as two characters.
We use a character as a unit of measurement for the length of a string.
in this case each of this character represent bytes of data.
how much bytes?
1 byte = 8 bits
1 character = 1 byte
1 character = 8 bits
1 character = 8 bits of data
